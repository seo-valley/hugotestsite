**Think Design restores clarity to your company’s unique vision and helps you meet your audience where they are.**

I graduated in industrial design at the start of the dot com boom. As a maker and a solver, I was immediately keen to explore the application of Dieter Rams’ principles of good design, online.

After three years' building transparent commodity-pricing solutions in London, I sold my company stake and moved back to New York City.

I arrived just as corporate America realized the internet was the next frontier for commerce, founding Think Design in New York in 1997 to help clients thrive in this brave new world.

Our first customer was Pfizer’s marketing technology team and the following decade brought work from cultural institutions such as The New-York Historical Society, the BBC and The Writers Guild of America.

In all our work, we identify and help to remove those obstacles which hinder our clients’ progress, building bespoke solutions to meet each project’s need.

> “We have technology, finally, that for the first time in human history allows people to really maintain rich connections with much larger numbers of people.” – Pierre Omidyar, founder, eBay.

Twenty-two years ago, Think Design was ahead of the curve, delivering cutting-edge digital design at a time when an online presence was an afterthought for many companies. Now, a brand-aligned web strategy is vital for everyone.

Since inception, we've worked in direct partnership with Fortune 100 companies, leading cultural institutions and non-profits to reimagine and revitalize their core message at every stage of the internet's growth.

Our structured, immersive process takes clients and key stakeholders on a journey to the heart of their brand, often revealing new or forgotten motivations and information. With known and newly rediscovered elements in hand, we assemble them to resonate with target client and stakeholder groups.
