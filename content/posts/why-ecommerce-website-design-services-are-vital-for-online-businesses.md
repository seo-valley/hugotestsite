An online store typically requires less capital and is easier to run compared to a brick-and-mortar store. On top of that, it allows you to cater to customers from anywhere in the world. You can even automate some of its elements to make it even easier to manage. However, just like any business, an online shop will only be successful if it’s planned out well. You have to do everything properly from the start.

Perhaps the most important aspect of starting an online business is e-commerce website designing. Be sure to work with [ecommerce website builders](https://thinkdesign.com/services/e-commerce/) who can help you design and launch an online shop that is ready for growth. Here’s why it’s important to hire professional designers:

1. **Making a good first impression.**
   Have you ever passed by a storefront and was immediately drawn to it because of the aesthetics? Website design works similarly.
   When customers come across a visually appealing site, they are more likely to stay. Studies have shown that 75% of users judge a company’s credibility based on their website design. And as you probably already know, it only takes most people a split second to form a first impression. Poor site composition may lead potential customers to doubt your products and services, and they might end up going to a different site altogether.

2. **Well-designed websites increase customer conversion.**
   Your website is not for you — it’s for your customers. User experience is an essential consideration in ecommerce website designing.
   What makes for a good user experience? According to UX experts a site has to be useful, usable, findable, credible, desirable, accessible, and valuable. Sounds overwhelming, but with professional ecommerce website builders, everything will be a breeze. Good UX uses design elements to lead customers to precisely what they’re looking for, ultimately increasing customer conversion.

3. **Responsive websites reach more clients.**
   When it comes to online services, you need to consider that not everyone uses a PC to access the Internet. Mobile devices are more accessible and affordable for most people. In fact, 4 out of 5 shoppers are known to shop on their phones. Over 60% of companies with smartphone-compatible website design saw an increase in their sales. This is why you need to look for reliable ecommerce website builders that can make your site look good and function properly on any screen size and device.
