The New-York Historical Society turned to Think Design to make their extensive American Revolution-related collection available through the Web.

The site we delivered featured a web-based collections management application (CMA) used by many researchers, whose content fed straight into the website collection.

## Curate online exhibitions

We also created a build-an-exhibition feature that enabled students and visitors to curate exhibitions online, which could then be made public.

This project saw us handle all aspects of Project Management, including additional recruitment where necessary. Through our interactive process, we defined a new Information Architecture and reimagined all elements of the User experience and development of the public, museum, teacher, and student-facing pages.

Bringing the New-York Historical Society's collection online through a captivating digital experience enables all generations to imagine the American Revolution and globally expand the Society's audience.
