Retail sales staff never quite knew what they were going to earn at Giorgio Armani and DKNY.

A customer who bought a suit in New York might return it up to a year later in LA, and the commission earned was deducted from their paycheck. This scenario led to frequent tension and mistrust.

## Commissions management for global retail

To address this, Think Design built a commissions management system on top of existing sales audit and employee database systems.

Sales staff could now see how much commission they earned from any point-of-sale terminal, and store managers view store earnings, both in real-time.

The new system added transparency, so sales staff could anticipate what their paycheck was, increasing trust in the retailer and reducing staff turnover.
