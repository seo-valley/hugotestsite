## [Digital Strategy](digital-strategy "Strategy")

Our consultants create a cohesive online presence for your brand, promoting your core values to your audience. We target your desired demographic with inbound & outbound marketing. Our metric tracking of campaigns ensures your presence evolves alongside your market. You get a digital strategy that builds a compelling digital presence.

## [Web Development](web-development "Development")

Think Design's Web development capabilities take your website to the next level. We make sure the technical aspects of your site are the best fit for the visual design elements and functionality you require and are ready to support your marketing needs. Choosing the right architecture and software to future-proof your site is one of the reasons you need a web development team you can trust. With so many developers out there to choose from and high risk to your venture from poorly executed development, our experience is your refuge.

## [User Experience (UX)](user-experience-ux "UX")

When prospective users land on your website, you have a few seconds, at most, to win them over. The most compelling reasons for them to stay are that your site gives them what they need and makes them happy. The process of discovering and delivering those requirements is best achieved through expertise in user experience design. Putting your audience first and understanding how they want to interact with and navigate your website is our specialty.

## [Website Design](web-design "web design")

Think Design is a full-service web development company with more than 25 years of experience. Wherever you are in the process of creating or evolving your web presence, whether a small business or multinational conglomerate, we are here to help you. Working with us means getting personal attention from a strategic partner who knows what you need.

## [B2B](b2b-web-development "business to business")

To engage efficiently and effectively with customers and partners, your site has to communicate your core values and expertise, your business culture, and enable easy access to all relevant information about your products and services. We have two decades of experience building for Fortune 100 companies, delivering innovative, fast, secure sites with functionality geared to delivering growth and customer satisfaction.

## [Marketing](marketing/ "Marketing")

How do people find your website if they don’t know you already? When people search for things on Google, about 90% of visitors will click on sites that are on the first page. Expertise in ranking your site on that first page is known as Search Engine Optimization (SEO). SEO encompasses a wide array of knowledge as to what Google wants to share and how they value the various components of marketing. Our services can deliver both the site your audience craves and the ability for it to be discovered quickly.

## [E-commerce](/services/e-commerce/)

More than ever, e-commerce is the lifeblood of small business. COVID-19 has disrupted the global economy, with physical distancing measures imposed all over the world directly impacting business. As we navigate the pandemic, e-commerce offers a proven solution to protect store staff and customers while keeping the economy moving. Think Design’s 5-step pragmatic solution is designed to keep your sales volume up and grow your customer base.

## [Nonprofit](/services/non-profit/)

Think Design has been building with nonprofits large and small for more than 20 years. Our nonprofit web developer service understands the needs of organizations focused on improving life for their communities. Whether you provide services in the arts, social justice, civic spaces, organizing, or social services, we have the insight and experience enabling you to fulfil your mission and connect with your audiences.

## [Education](/services/education/)

Your institute’s website sits at the heart of the community you serve. Today, your online presence is not just the focus for students, families, faculty, and staff, it also serves as your primary marketing platform, and, during the global health crisis, replaces the classroom. The right web design partner helps you educate and lead while holding open a space for interaction and feedback to increase knowledge.

## Museums

One of the great pleasures of visiting a museum is browsing the exhibits and interacting with the world they create. We specialize in the curation of virtual exhibits for and by your audience, providing the internet visitor an immersive online experience. For the institution, our services include building tools to help you behind the scenes, such as virtual picture frame matching service or label creation processes. Your ability to communicate with audiences as well as staff, exhibitors, and trades can be enabled through a holistic design process, as required.
