## Education Website Design

Educational institutions need a web design & development partner that has the experience and insight to deliver a site that becomes a hub for the whole community each school, college, and university builds, represents, and supports.

For more than 12 years Think Design has served the education sector, delivering secure, innovative sites that enable students, parents, faculty, staff, and funders to share information and interact. As your online presence, your website is the primary and most effective marketing product you will create.

## Your student’s online education and support portal
More than ever, your institute’s website is required to maximize the opportunities to facilitate learning and deliver community support. Though the Coronavirus pandemic may diminish in importance, learning, community building, and the internet will not, and an effective web platform that meets today’s challenges will hold any institute in good stead for whatever the future brings.

## Your website, your values
As an educational institute, the way information is shared is central to your mission and expresses your culture. Your website is your digital mission statement. It stands testament to your ability to improve every aspect of the lives you touch. Delivering the required functionality while enhancing your brand is one of the benefits of having Think Design as your experienced education website design partner.

## What else can my educational website do?

Your website can combine any aspect of a community hub, administrative portal, and information provision for all your visitors. Through our education website design discovery process, the focus of the website and online tools will be considered from the perspective of all stakeholders, with particular attention on how users and the institute can both maximize the potential for interaction and data insights offered by today’s cutting edge web tools.
