Think Design has been building with nonprofits large and small for more than 20 years. Our nonprofit web developer service understands the needs of organizations focused on improving life for their communities. Whether you provide services in the arts, social justice, civic spaces, organizing, or social services, Think Design has the insight and experience to deliver digital design and web development that serve your mission and meet the challenges you face.

## Nonprofit website design NYC

Enabling clients such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art to do their work more effectively, or helping the New-York Historical Society to inspire their visitors online are part of our story in New York City. From tiny innovative startup social services to giant institutions in a multi-sided ecosystem, we have the skills to help you stand out in the nonprofit landscape.

## Optimizing Donations

Our team has experience optimizing donation forms to maximize return from donors.

## Lived Experience and User Experience

Just as lived experience adds value in designing and delivering social services, having a nonprofit web developer that has worked in and around the sector will benefit you. Think Design provides a team with first-hand nonprofit experience, with a history of creating and building technology for the public good.

User experience (UX) enables visitors to your website, or users of your digital products, to find what they need intuitively. Good user experience design means providing people not just with efficiency but with delight. Our team has decades of experience in the nonprofit sector helping organizations achieve objectives and goals more effectively through good design.

## User-centered design

To best tell your story through your website, whether to funders, staff, clients, or other visitors, you will benefit from Think Design’s deep knowledge of user-centered design. A clear and strong web presence should be informed not only by your perspective but by the perspective of your audience. Think Design discovers what your audience wants from you online, as opposed to what they need from you in the real world.

## SEO for nonprofits

It is quite common for nonprofits to ignore search engine optimization (SEO), historically the preserve of commercial companies with marketing gurus. But clients and funders will come to you first if they find you online before other organizations, and especially if you are on the first page of Google. SEO for nonprofits is a key service that can help your community find your services. If you search on Google for the services your nonprofit provides and don’t see your organization in the first few pages, we can help you.

## Full-service

As your strategic creative partner, we supply a holistic suite of services to meet any scope. For single entities or multinational NGOs, from consultation through design and development to SEO, training, support, and maintenance, we are ready to help bring your vision to life.

For all your needs from nonprofit website design, NYC, national, or global, please reach out to us through our request a quote page and we’ll get back to you in no time.
